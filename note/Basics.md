## Container and VM

Both container and VM are able to isolate resources, but container is more efficient and swift.

VM = User apps + Binarys / Library Files + Guest OS

Container = User apps + Binarys / Library Files

Note that containers share the same kernal (Docker Engine) while each VM has its own Guest OS.
